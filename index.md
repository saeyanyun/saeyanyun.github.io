## About me

Hi, I'm Saeyan Yun. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Measurement and Statistics at Florida State University (FSU). 

I am currently working with [Dr. Betsy Jane Becker](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=brgMxQwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Qian (Jackie) Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Op7FwQAAAAJ&hl=en). I also work as an intern in the Psychometric Team at the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) under a contract with FSU and FLDOE.

## Research Interests
1. Applying machine learning techniques and Bayesian methods to overcome the limitations of traditional meta-analysis (ongoing dissertation project). 
2. Developing advanced models for detecting bias in the measurement context. 
3. Collaborating with applied researchers to understand students' behaviors in an online learning setting ([Augmented Reality](http://https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-024-10385-7) and [Digital Distraction](https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/engineering_pub/2/)).

## Professional Experience
- **Psychometric Intern** - Florida Department of Education (FLDOE), May 2022 â€“ present
  - Ensured accuracy of large-scale state assessments by replicating and validating statistical analyses for Florida students, in collaboration with psychometricians from four different testing firms and key stakeholders.  
  - Communicated complex psychometric terms and results to a non-technical audience to support data-informed decision-making.   <br>
(This internship is part of a graduate assistantship under a contract between Florida State University and the Florida Department of Education.)

- **Research Assistant** - Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI), June 2018 â€“ July 2018
  - Conducted a 1% sampling design from all national schools to improve school culture in South Korea, resulting in comprehensive data collection from a representative sample.  
  - Developed and distributed surveys via SurveyMonkey, and communicated with stakeholders to encourage participation and increase survey response rates.   <br>
(Completed a one-month research contract at the Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI).)

## Publications
(â€  co-first author)
- Na, H., & Yun, Sâ€ .(2024). The effect of augmented reality on K-12 studentsâ€™ motivation: A meta-analysis. _Educational Technology Research and Development_, 1-32.  <br>
  - Examined the effect of augmented reality (AR) interventions on K-12 studentsâ€™ motivation by statistically integrating the effect sizes of 141 studies from 45 primary studies (_n_ = 3,303).  <br>
  - The treatment group with AR interventions showed higher motivation than the control group (ES = 0.8). In particular, AR type (_Q_ = 4.36) and collaborative learning (_Q_ = 8.40) were significant moderators to explain between-studies variance.   <br>
  
- Choi, H., & Yun, Sâ€ .(2024). Digital Distraction on Academic Performance: An HLM Study on K-12 Learners. _The Journal of Applied Instructional Design_, 13(2), 49-55.
  - Analyzed data from 11,237 students across 95 online courses using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM).  <br>
  - Level 1 analysis indicated that digital distractions had a significant negative effect on student performance (_Î²_ = -1.81, _p_ < .001). Female students performed better than males (_Î²_ = 1.73, _p_ < .001), while average student age did not moderate this effect.

## Selected Conferences / Talks  
- Li, W., Yun, S., Yao, Y., Morshed, M. N., Velasquez, G., Ming, J., Luo, Y., Binici, S., Yang, Y., & Becker, B. J. (2025, April). _Evaluating intersectional DIF via logistic regression: A simulation study._ Poster presentation at American Educational Research Association (AERA), Denver, CO, United States.  <br>
  - Suggested a unified multivariate Logistic Regression (LR) model to detect intersectional DIF.  <br> 
  - Imbalanced sample-size patterns and number of DIF items had little impact on bias detection, given the same ability distributions, and varied ability distributions had a major impact on detection, given the same sample-size patterns and number of DIF items.  <br>

- Yun, S., Li, W., Yao, Y., Morshed, M. N., Velasquez, G., Ming, J., Luo, Y., Binici, S., Yang, Y., & Becker, B. J. (2024, November). _Intersectional DIF in imbalanced samples: A simulation study._ Paper presentation at Florida Education Research Association (FERA), Orlando, FL, United States.  <br>
  - Applied a unified multivariate Logistic Regression (LR) model to detect intersectional DIF, which make able to the LR model to predict the probability of correct item responses due to DIF across all examinees and DIF cases.  <br>
  - Power for detecting DIF tended to increase as the total sample size and/or the DIF magnitude increased. DIF-detection rates decreased as the sample-size ratio got more extreme.

- Yun, S.â€ , (2022, November). _Application of K-modes clustering to meta-analysis data._ Poster presentation at Florida Educational Research Association, Daytona Beach, FL, United States.  <br>
  - Applied K-modes clustering, an unsupervised learning method, to examine how individual studies in meta-analysis datasets group together based on their categorical study features.  <br>
  - Results showed that studies sharing similar features were consistently grouped into 5 and 10 clusters based on the elbow curve, helping researchers to identify patterns of replicability in research.  

**Invited Talks**
