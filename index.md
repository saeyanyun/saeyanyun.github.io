## About me

Hi, I'm Saeyan Yun. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Measurement and Statistics at Florida State University (FSU). 

I am currently working with [Dr. Betsy Jane Becker](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=brgMxQwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Qian (Jackie) Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Op7FwQAAAAJ&hl=en). I also work as an intern in the Psychometric Team at the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) under a contract with FSU and FLDOE.

## Research Interests
1. Applying machine learning techniques and Bayesian methods to overcome the limitations of traditional meta-analysis (ongoing, dissertation project). 
2. Developing a unified model for detecting bias in the measurement context. 
3. Collaborating with applied researchers to understand students' behaviors in an online learning setting ([Augmented Reality](http://https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-024-10385-7) and [Digital Distraction](https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/engineering_pub/2/)).
