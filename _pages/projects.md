## Additional ML/Stat Projects

**1. Loan Approval Prediction** | Python, Scikit-learn, PyTorch *(Sep 2024 – Oct 2024)*  
• Achieved a 96% ROC-AUC by developing and tuning ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CATBoost) and neural networks using Optuna optimization and weighted model blending.  

**2. Plant Pathology High-Dimensional Data** | Python, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras *(Oct 2022 – Dec 2022)*  
• Improved CNN accuracy by 18% via dropout regularization and deeper architectures, outperforming RF and SVM models on plant disease image classification. 

**3. Predict COVID-19 Cases Using Amazon Reviews** | R, SPSS *(Mar 2023 – Mar 2023)*  
• Replicated Beauchamp (2020)'s time-series study that analyzed Amazon candle reviews to track COVID-19 case trends. 
• Applied linear regression and time-series modeling to examine whether weekly "no smell" reviews predict COVID case counts in the U.S. 
• Validated the original findings that "no smell" review frequency correlates with pandemic waves, highlighting how user-generated data can serve as real-time health indicators. 

**4. Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease Causes** | Python, Scikit-learn *(Sep 2022 – Oct 2022)*  
• Identified key brain biomarkers for Alzheimer’s diagnosis using RF, SVM, PCA, k-means, and NMF on neuroimaging data; hippocampal volume emerged as a top predictor.

**5. Missing Data Analysis using Gun Death Data** | Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib, missigno *(Oct 2022 – Dec 2022)*  
• Compared the simple imputation and multiple imputation under the multivariate regression model.
