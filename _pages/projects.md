## Additional ML Projects

**1. Loan Approval Prediction** | Python, Scikit-learn, PyTorch *(Sep 2024 – Oct 2024)*  
• Achieved a 96% ROC-AUC by developing and tuning ensemble models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CATBoost) and neural networks using Optuna optimization and weighted model blending.  

**2. Plant Pathology High-Dimensional Data** | Python, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras *(Oct 2022 – Dec 2022)*  
• Improved CNN accuracy by 18% via dropout regularization and deeper architectures, outperforming RF and SVM models on plant disease image classification.  

**3. Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease Causes** | Python, Scikit-learn *(Sep 2022 – Oct 2022)*  
• Identified key brain biomarkers for Alzheimer’s diagnosis using RF, SVM, PCA, k-means, and NMF on neuroimaging data; hippocampal volume emerged as a top predictor.
