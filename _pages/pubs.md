## Publications
(† co-first author)

- Na, H., & **Yun, S.**† (2024). *The effect of augmented reality on K–12 students’ motivation: A meta-analysis.* _Educational Technology Research and Development_, 1–32.  
  •	Examined the effect of augmented reality (AR) interventions on K-12 students’ motivation by statistically integrating the effect sizes of 141 studies from 45 primary studies (n = 3,303).  
  •	The treatment group with AR interventions showed higher motivation than the control group (ES = 0.8). In particular, AR type (Q = 4.36) and collaborative learning (Q = 8.40) were significant moderators to explain between-studies variance. 

- Choi, H., & **Yun, S.**† (2024). *Digital Distraction on Academic Performance: An HLM Study on K–12 Learners.* _The Journal of Applied Instructional Design_, 13(2), 49–55.  
  •	Analyzed data from 11,237 students across 95 online courses using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM).  
  •	Level 1 analysis indicated that digital distractions had a significant negative effect on student performance (β = -1.81, p < .001). Female students performed better than males (β = 1.73, p < .001), while average student age did not moderate this effect.

## Conferences / Talks
1. Li, W., **Yun, S.**, Yao, Y., Morshed, M. N., Velasquez, G., Ming, J., Luo, Y., Binici, S., Yang, Y., & Becker, B. J. (2025, April). _Evaluating intersectional DIF via logistic regression: A simulation study._ Poster, AERA, Denver, CO, USA.  
   •	Suggested a unified multivariate Logistic Regression (LR) model to detect intersectional DIF.  
   •	Imbalanced sample-size patterns and number of DIF items had little impact on bias detection, given the same ability distributions, and varied ability distributions had a major impact on detection, given the same sample-size patterns and number of DIF items.  
   
3. **Yun, S.**, Li, W., Yao, Y., Morshed, M. N., Velasquez, G., Ming, J., Luo, Y., Binici, S., Yang, Y., & Becker, B. J. (2024, November). _Intersectional DIF in imbalanced samples: A simulation study._ Paper, FERA, Orlando, FL, USA.  
   •	Applied a unified multivariate Logistic Regression (LR) model to detect intersectional DIF, which make able to the LR model to predict the probability of correct item responses due to DIF across all examinees and DIF cases.  
   •	Power for detecting DIF tended to increase as the total sample size and/or the DIF magnitude increased. DIF-detection rates decreased as the sample-size ratio got more extreme.  
   
4. Na, H., & **Yun, S.**† (2023, October). _Can AR promote K–12 students’ motivation? A meta-analysis._ Paper, AECT, Orlando, FL, USA.
   
5. Choi, H., & **Yun, S.**† (2023, October). _Digital distraction on academic performance in self-paced online learning: An HLM study._ Poster, AECT, Orlando, FL, USA.
   
6. **Yun, S.**, Na, H. (2023, April). _The effect of Augmented Reality on K–12 students’ motivation: A meta-analysis._ Poster, AERA, Chicago, IL, USA.
   
7. **Yun, S.**† (2022, November). _Application of K-modes clustering to meta-analysis data._ Poster, FERA, Daytona Beach, FL, USA.  
   • Applied K-modes clustering, an unsupervised learning method, to examine how individual studies in meta-analysis datasets group together based on their categorical study features.  
   •	Results showed that studies sharing similar features were consistently grouped into 5 and 10 clusters based on the elbow curve, helping researchers to identify patterns of replicability in research.  

8. **Yun, S.**, Shin, T. (2019, April). _The effect of school violence prevention programs on SEL competencies in South Korea: A meta-analysis._ Poster, AERA, Toronto, Canada.
