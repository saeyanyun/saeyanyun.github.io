## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the intersection of **educational measurement**, **statistics**, and **machine learning**.  
Specifically, I am interested in:

- Bayesian modeling and hierarchical analysis  
- Causal inference and simulation studies  
- Psychometric methods for educational assessment  
- Multilevel and structural equation modeling  
- Applications of machine learning in measurement and survey analytics
